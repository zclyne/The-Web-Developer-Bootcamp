REST: a way of mapping http routes and crud together (crud: create, read, update, destroy)
PUT: another http method which updates data, rather than post new data to the db
<%- %>: return the content inside of it and evaluate it to html
sanitize: prevents user from adding script code into the blog contents that will be executed
